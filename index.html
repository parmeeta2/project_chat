  ["Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another due to a change in its speed."],
  ["Diffraction is the bending of light around obstacles and the spreading of light waves when they pass through small openings."],
  ["Interference occurs when two or more light waves overlap and combine to form a new wave pattern, either amplifying or canceling out."],

  ["A prism is a transparent optical element that refracts light and can separate it into its component colors."],
  ["Total internal reflection happens when light strikes a surface at an angle greater than the critical angle, causing it to reflect entirely within the medium."],
  ["The refractive index is a measure of how much light slows down when passing through a medium. It's calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed in the medium."],
  ["Optical fiber uses light to transmit data over long distances through total internal reflection, allowing for high-speed communication."],
  ["A microscope is an optical instrument used to magnify small objects, using lenses to focus light on the sample."],
  ["A telescope is an instrument that gathers and magnifies light to observe distant objects, commonly used in astronomy."],
  ["Chromatic aberration occurs when different wavelengths of light are focused at different points, leading to color fringing in images."],
